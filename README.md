# Vax-Man Game - EA Internship Task
For my virtual internship with EA game studios, I was assigned to change the logic in Pacman using Python. 

Original PacMan code found here: https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, PyGame

I used the base code for PacMan to understand the Python language, then went in and updated the original rules to the new ones: 
- Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
- Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
- Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
- The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time reading and working with the Python language. I learned the basic syntax and logic needed in the game and made my changes through trial and error. Eventually, with my newfound understanding of Python, Vax-Man was created.
